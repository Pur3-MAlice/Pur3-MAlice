### :woman_technologist: About Me :
I am a Developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> from the UK.

- :telescope: I am currently enrolled in the _Diploma in Full Stack Software Development_ course at [:o: Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net), where I am expanding my skillset and knowledge of software development and how code can change the world.

- :boom: I am highly motivated to constantly develop my skills. There's nothing that fires me up more than an interesting project and a challenge! Please feel free to peruse any of my projects - I welcome any comments, feedback, or advice!

- :seedling: I have over 2 years of experience with HTML and CSS. And have mastered JavaScript and jQuery through my many projects. I've recently moved on to discover more about Django, SQL and Databases! Feel free to have a look at my projects below.

- :zap: In my free time, I read tech articles, play a lot of Stardew Valley, and brush up on my coding skills.

- :sparkles: On my GitHub profile, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my abilities and who I am. I am particularly interested in cool CSS tricks, interesting UX/UI, APIs, and how to use Javascript to create really cool, accessible interactive websites that excite end-users.

### :floppy_disk: My Projects:
 - 

<h3>Bear Minimum</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bear Minimum is an info-tainment (information/entertainment) website educating users on sustainability. The main aim of the website is provide useful advice and information about ways to slowly create a sustainable lifestyle in modern society as well as encourage users to 'get back to nature'. There's very little out there about general encouragement to lead a slightly more sustainable life, a lot of the media around being environmentally friendly is 100% effort or nothing. This website is trying to bridge this gap and create a more positive outlook on both sustainability and Climate Change. </li></li>
  <li>Live Link: https://pur3-malice.github.io/bear-minimum//</li>
  <li>Git hub repo: https://github.com/Pur3-MAlice/bear-minimum</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stardew Valley Memory Game</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stardew Valley Memory Game is a nostalgic card flipping/matching game based on the images and source material of the cult game Stardew Valley. The main aim of the website is to provide a relaxing and entertaining game that users can go up or down in difficulty - the games shouldn't be so difficult that the experience is stressful. The experience of this site should be happy calm and relaxed whilst player are able to keep track of their highest scores. </li>

  <li>Git hub repo: https://reading-list-alice.herokuapp.com/</li>
</ul>
   
<h3>Seasonality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This website has been built as a digital cookbook. Where people can upload their own recipes, comment, favourite and rate other people's submissions (including the admin's). This website aims to target the lack of community and collaboration within recipe websites. User submission gives the user a level of control, whilst the admin is also in charge of making sure the community is staying safe. It also aims to tackle the preamble that comes before recipes on websites that people find annoying, even if it is good SEO.</li>
